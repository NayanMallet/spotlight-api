# Spotlight API

This repository contains a RESTful API built with AdonisJS and Docker. The application uses MySQL as its database.

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (if running locally)
- [PNPM](https://pnpm.io/installation) (if running locally)

## Environment Setup

The application uses environment variables defined in the `.env` file. A sample configuration is provided below:

```
TZ=UTC
PORT=3333
HOST=0.0.0.0
LOG_LEVEL=info
APP_KEY=tiELO02WS3byq4rRiE18S9HWW3bx9J8G
NODE_ENV=development
DB_HOST=mysql_db
DB_PORT=3306
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=root
DB_DATABASE=spotlight
```

## Docker Commands

### Starting the Application

To start the application and database services:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

To run in detached mode (background):

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### Stopping the Application

To stop the running containers:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

To stop and remove volumes (this will delete all data):

```bash
docker-compose down -v
```

### Viewing Logs

To view logs from all services:

```bash
docker-compose logs
```

To follow logs in real-time:

```bash
docker-compose logs -f
```

To view logs for a specific service:

```bash
docker-compose logs spotlight_api
docker-compose logs mysql_db
```

### Rebuilding the Application

If you make changes to the Dockerfile or application code:

```bash
docker-compose build
# or
docker-compose up --build
```

### Executing Commands Inside Containers

To run commands inside the application container:

```bash
docker-compose exec spotlight_api sh
```

To run database migrations:

```bash
docker-compose exec spotlight_api node ace migration:run
```

To run database seeders:

```bash
docker-compose exec spotlight_api node ace db:seed
```

## Running Locally (Without Docker)

### Installation

```bash
pnpm install
```

### Database Setup

Make sure you have a MySQL server running and update the `.env` file with your database credentials.

### Running Migrations

```bash
node ace migration:run
```

### Starting the Development Server

```bash
node ace serve --hmr
```

### Building for Production

```bash
pnpm run build
```

### Running Tests

The project uses [Japa](https://japa.dev/) as the testing framework with AdonisJS integration. Tests are organized into two suites:

- **Unit Tests**: Fast, isolated tests for individual components (2s timeout)
- **Functional Tests**: Integration tests for API endpoints (30s timeout)

#### Local Development

```bash
# Run all tests
pnpm test

# Run specific test suite
node ace test --suites=unit
node ace test --suites=functional

# Run tests with file watching (development)
node ace test --watch

# Run tests with coverage
node ace test --coverage

# Run specific test file
node ace test tests/functional/auth/login_controller.spec.ts

# Run tests matching a pattern
node ace test --grep="login"
```

#### Docker Environment

```bash
# Run all tests in Docker container
docker-compose exec spotlight_api pnpm test

# Run specific test suite in Docker
docker-compose exec spotlight_api node ace test --suites=unit
docker-compose exec spotlight_api node ace test --suites=functional

# Run tests with file watching in Docker
docker-compose exec spotlight_api node ace test --watch

# Run specific test file in Docker
docker-compose exec spotlight_api node ace test tests/functional/auth/login_controller.spec.ts
```

#### Test Structure

```
tests/
├── bootstrap.ts          # Japa configuration and plugins
├── unit/                 # Unit tests (isolated, fast)
│   └── auth/            # Authentication unit tests
└── functional/          # Integration tests (API endpoints)
    ├── auth/            # Authentication API tests
    └── events/          # Events API tests
```

#### Writing Tests

Tests use Japa with the following plugins:
- `@japa/assert`: Assertions library
- `@japa/api-client`: HTTP client for API testing
- `@japa/plugin-adonisjs`: AdonisJS integration

Example functional test:
```typescript
import { test } from '@japa/runner'
import { ApiClient } from '@japa/api-client'

test.group('Auth - Login Controller', () => {
  test('should login user with valid credentials', async ({ client }: { client: ApiClient }) => {
    const response = await client
      .post('/login')
      .json({
        email: 'test@example.com',
        password: 'password123'
      })

    response.assertStatus(200)
    response.assertBodyContains({
      user: {
        email: 'test@example.com'
      }
    })
  })
})
```

#### Test Database

Tests automatically use a separate test database configuration. The test environment:
- Uses `NODE_ENV=test`
- Runs database migrations automatically
- Cleans up data between test runs
- Uses in-memory database for faster execution (when configured)

#### Continuous Integration

For CI/CD pipelines, run tests with:
```bash
# Set test environment
export NODE_ENV=test

# Run database migrations
node ace migration:run

# Run all tests
pnpm test

# Generate coverage report
node ace test --coverage --reporter=lcov
```

## API Testing with Postman

### Postman Collection

A comprehensive Postman collection (`postman_collection.json`) is included in the repository to test all API features. The collection includes:

- **Authentication**: Registration, login, OAuth flows for multiple providers
- **User Management**: Profile updates, account deletion, banner uploads
- **Events Management**: Full CRUD operations for events
- **Artists Management**: Full CRUD operations for artists
- **Messages Management**: Full CRUD operations for messages
- **Event-Artist Relationships**: Managing artist associations with events
- **Testing Scenarios**: Complete workflows for common use cases

### Setting Up Postman Environment

1. **Import the Collection**:
   - Open Postman
   - Click "Import" and select `postman_collection.json`
   - The collection will be imported with all endpoints and test scripts

2. **Configure Environment Variables**:
   Create a new environment in Postman with the following variables:
   ```
   base_url: http://localhost:3333 (or your server URL)
   auth_token: (will be set automatically after login/register)
   user_id: (will be set automatically after login/register)
   event_id: (will be set automatically after creating an event)
   artist_id: (will be set automatically after creating an artist)
   message_id: (will be set automatically after creating a message)
   oauth_code: (for OAuth testing - get from OAuth provider)
   oauth_state: (for OAuth testing - get from OAuth provider)
   reset_token: (for password reset testing - get from email)
   ```

3. **OAuth Testing Setup**:
   For OAuth testing, you'll need to:
   - Configure OAuth providers in your `.env` file
   - Use the redirect endpoints to get authorization codes
   - Update the `oauth_code` and `oauth_state` variables manually

### Running Tests

1. **Individual Endpoints**: Run any endpoint individually by selecting it and clicking "Send"

2. **Complete Workflows**: Use the "Testing Scenarios" folder for end-to-end testing:
   - **Complete User Workflow**: Registration → Profile Update → Password Reset → Login → Account Deletion
   - **Complete Event Creation Workflow**: User Registration → Artist Creation → Event Creation → Verification

3. **Automated Testing**: The collection includes test scripts that:
   - Automatically set environment variables from responses
   - Validate response structure and data
   - Check HTTP status codes
   - Ensure proper authentication flow

### Test Data Management

- The collection uses dynamic data and environment variables
- Test users are created with unique emails using timestamps
- Created resources (events, artists, messages) are automatically linked
- Clean up is handled through the testing scenarios

## Testing Guidelines

### Manual Testing

1. **Start the Application**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

2. **Run Database Migrations**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose exec spotlight_api node ace migration:run
   ```

3. **Import Postman Collection** and configure environment variables

4. **Test Authentication Flow**:
   - Register a new user
   - Login with credentials
   - Test OAuth providers (if configured)
   - Test password reset functionality

5. **Test CRUD Operations**:
   - Create, read, update, and delete artists
   - Create, read, update, and delete events
   - Associate artists with events
   - Create, read, update, and delete messages

### Automated Testing

Run the test suite:
```bash
pnpm test
```

### API Documentation

Access the interactive API documentation:
- **Swagger UI**: http://localhost:3333/docs
- **OpenAPI Spec**: http://localhost:3333/swagger

## Project Structure
